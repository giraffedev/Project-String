# Project-String
Useful php library containing translations for different languages of different strings.

# How to install
It's very easy to install the library, all you have to do is to include the class in your php file using the namespace: Language\String

# How to use
After you had included the class, everything is self explanatory. To retrieve a string use echo String::lang(language)->get(string_name); . You can also set the page's language and after just retrieve the string like this: String::set(language); String::get(string_name);

# How to contribute
You can always help this little project by contributing with translations, or making improvements.
